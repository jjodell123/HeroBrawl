# HeroBrawl

This was the largest game I built in high school. Hero Brawl is a game side-scroller shooter game that I made in high school for my friends and I to play. Like all the Java games Iâ€™ve made, I built Hero Brawl from scratch and without engines or plugins. It is an online game where each character is modeled off of one of my friends, so that they can play with their own individual traits. The game includes basic physics and movement in a 2D environment, and incorporates basic networking protocols.

I spent a lot of time on the game, but very little on the UI (and it shows, haha). Here are the steps to run it:
1. Once you run the jar file, you will have a blue screen with a start/load server button, and another red box in the top left. Use the red box in the top left to select a name. 2. Click start/load server
3. If you are the host, choose a port you want to open the server on (I didn't know enough about networking at the time to know which ports it should be). Click Open Server on the window that pops up.
4. Once a server is started (either by you or someone else), enter the server host's IP and port under host IP and host port. Then click Find Server.
5. Once you have entered a game, you will be given the option to choose your character. Click on the box above the correspponding name, and hit start
5a. The characters were based on some of my friends; however, selecting JJ (me) gives you the best stats. Whoops...
6. From here, use W to move left, D to move right, W to jump, Space to fire a bullet, and S to automatically die and reselect a character. Other than that, the goal is to shoot any other people without getting hit yourself! (You can respawn though so it's fine).

PLEASE NOTE: This was made in high school, and this was also before I realized code style and documentation were important things. Still, it is probably the most fun game I made in high school and my friends and I had a good time  playing it.
